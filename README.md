## A new app skeleton for Meteor/React

**Note: this is experimental, doesn't work with all Meteor packages, and you may run into issues that can only be solved by deep investigation of what Isobuild, Babel, and Webpack do (or by cloning code from Meteor packages straight into your project).**  If you're not willing to get your hands dirty, using Crater may not be worthwhile.  Please pressure MDG to refactor all core Meteor packages as pure NPM packages.

It's 2016, and your Meteor app has crash landed in the middle of a more advanced JavaScript civilization, leaving a crater full of mangled and poorly forked npm packages and antique build tools.  You climb out of the ruins of your Celestial-Body-as-a-Service and wonder, how can I pick up the pieces and keep going in this new ecosystem?

If you can't start over (i.e. switch to [Meatier](https://github.com/mattkrick/meatier), which I recommend highly) because your codebase is too firmly entrenched in Meteor, then you may find this app skeleton quite useful.

## Features

* You can run any server and client code except Meteor packages outside of Meteor's control (without running it through Isobuild)
* Starts faster than `meteor` dev mode
* Babel 6 with es2015, stage-1 presets by default
* Server uses `babel-register`
* Client code is bundled by Webpack
* Server creates an Express app and generates HTML pages with React SSR
* Automatic server restart via `smart-restart`
* react-hot-loader 3 (beta)
* redux
* react-router
* react-router-redux
* eslint, eslint-watch
* flow, flow-watch
* Very customizable
* Dockerfile included
* Webdriver.io + Mocha + Chai integration test setup
* Thoroughly integration-tested

## Rationale

Ever since I started using Meteor, Isobuild has been my biggest source of frustration with it, for the following
reasons:
* It made it more difficult to use Webpack with Meteor
* It's hard to customize index.html too much
* It's been horribly slow for me in recent versions
([Meteor build time/refresh time after file save is VERY slow](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/4284) --
over 90 upvotes and it's been open since April!)
* I want more control over my app structure
* I just want to be in control of the initial entry point, period.

Well, thanks to [babel-plugin-meteor-imports](https://github.com/jedwards1211/babel-plugin-meteor-imports) and
[meteor-imports-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/luisherranz/meteor-imports-webpack-plugin),
now it's possible to build and run the app without using isobuild on your userland code!  (It's only needed to
install and build meteor packages).

This should be a very helpful workaround for [https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/4284], because
**it doesn't output any transpiled files in dev mode**.

And for that and other reasons, this skeleton tends to start up faster than running the app through Meteor.

## How it works

**Special thanks to [Matt Krick](https://github.com/mattkrick), creator of
[Meatier](https://github.com/mattkrick/meatier) -- I learned a lot from
Meatier, and copped some of its code for this project**

`src/server/index.js` requires Meteor's `boot.js` to load all of the Meteor packages.  It then requires
`babel-register`, which uses `babel-plugin-meteor-imports` to rewrite statements like `import {Meteor} from
'meteor/meteor'` to `const {Meteor} = Package.meteor`.  On Meteor startup, it requires `src/server/server.js`,
which sets up an Express server.

The Express server is configured to perform React server-side rendering and added to `WebApp.rawConnectHandlers`.

The client-side code is bundled using Webpack and [meteor-imports-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/luisherranz/meteor-imports-webpack-plugin), and comes with all the usual
goodies in this skeleton: `react-hot-loader`, `redux`, `react-router`, `react-router-redux`.

In dev mode a webpack dev server is run on port 4000, with a proxy to the main app on port 3000.

In production the server-side code is also bundled using Webpack with `extract-text-webpack-plugin` so that it can
render React modules that require `.css` files.

## Where to put things

All of your server code should go in `src/server/index.js` or a file required by it.  You shouldn't require any app
code in `src/index.js`, because the production build makes a server-side Webpack bundle with
`src/server/index.js` as the entry point, so anything you require in `src/index.js` would be duplicated in the
Webpack bundle.

Put anything shared between client and server in `src/universal`.  Many Meteor methods are not
actually isomorphic (e.g. `Meteor.user()`, `Meteor.subscribe()`, `Mongo.Collection.find()`, etc) so you should probably
wrap those `Meteor.isClient`/`Meteor.isServer` blocks in any code shared between client and server.

If you want a different folder structure, it's perfectly possible to customize the run an build scripts to your liking.

## Blaze is not supported

See explanation [here](https://github.com/luisherranz/meteor-imports-webpack-plugin#the-bad-things).
A Webpack loader for Spacebars HTML templates could be implemented, but it's not a priority for me.

## react-meteor-data

Currently the Meteor package doesn't work with Crater.  As a superior alternative, use the version I published as a true NPM package:
```
npm install --save-dev react-meteor-data react-addons-pure-render-mixin
```
Then import it like this:
```es6
import {ReactMeteorData} from 'react-meteor-data'
```

## Version notes
* **Node**: Tested on the latest Node 4, 5, and 6 in Travis CI.  No effort will be made to support Node < 4.4.7.
* **Webpack**: The `master` branch currently works only with Webpack 1.  If you want to use Webpack 2, check out the [`webpack2` branch](https://github.com/jedwards1211/crater/tree/webpack2).

## Obtaining
```
git clone https://github.com/jedwards1211/crater
cd crater
git remote rename origin skeleton
```
Again, if you want to use webpack 2:
```
git checkout webpack2
```

## Updating
Some helpers used by the scripts are in the `crater-util` and `async-child-process` packages, so update those:
```
npm update --save-dev crater-util async-child-process
```
Otherwise it can be kind of awkward because you're free to modify anything in this skeleton.  Ideally you can just run
```
git pull skeleton master
```
and it will merge without conflicts, but if you've made many of your own changes, you'll probably have at least a few conflicts.
I don't really know of a way to make this easier than to make it a package that starts up everything and then calls your code.  But that's what Meteor does, which I'm trying to avoid because not being able to fully customize the bootstrap process and libraries used can be a real PITA sometimes.

## Running
Crater doesn't start a Mongo dev database, before running, you must start one by running `mongod` in a separate shell.

### Dev mode

*Note*: dev mode only renders a basic page on the server side; only prod mode and the built app render your routes
on the server side.
Make sure to install deps before running the app for the first time:
```
npm install
```

Then after that, run:
```
npm start
```
And open http://localhost:4000 in your browser. (It runs a webpack dev server on port 4000 and proxies to
the main server)

### Dev Debug mode
```
npm run debug
```
or
```
npm run debug-brk
```
And then go to the usual `node-inspector` URL, which will be printed in the console.

### Prod mode
```
npm run prod
```
And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Disabling full SSR in prod mode
As neat as it is, full-blown SSR requires more work and you might decide it's not worth it.
To only render an empty HTML document on the server and do everything else on the client, even in production,
set the `DISABLE_FULL_SSR` environment variable:
```
DISABLE_FULL_SSR=1 npm run prod # or npm run build, etc.
```
or look in `webpack/webpack.config.server.js` and uncomment the `DISABLE_FULL_SSR` line inside the
`webpack.DefinePlugin`.  If you build bundles this way, there will be no way to turn full SSR back on at runtime.

### Prod Debug mode
```
npm run prod:debug
```
or
```
npm run prod:debug-brk
```
And then go to the usual `node-inspector` URL, which will be printed in the console.

### Eslint/Flow
The following scripts are available:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run lint:fix`
- `npm run lint:watch`
- `npm run flow`
- `npm run flow:watch`

### Build
```
npm run build
```
Everything is output to the `build` directory.
Note that `npm run prod` runs this before starting the app.
`npm start` runs the `build:meteor` script, which partially populates this folder, before starting the app.

## Docker
**Note: the Dockerfile is configured to use Node 4.5, but feel free to change it in your own project.**

First build the docker image (this is currently set up to tag it as `jedwards1211/crater:$(git rev-parse HEAD)`):
```
npm run build:docker
```
Then you can run the docker image using: (requires `docker-compose`)
```
npm run docker
```
And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Environment variables

The npm scripts set default values for all required environment variables by running `defaultenv env/dev.js <command>`
or `defaultenv env/prod.js <command>`.

* `BUILD_DIR` - the build directory (defaults to `build` in the project root)
* `TARGET` - if you provide this, `BUILD_DIR` will default to `BUILD_DIR/TARGET` if not provided.
`process.env.TARGET` will also be defined in the client code via `webpack.DefinePlugin`.
* `PORT` - the port that the server runs on
* `WEBPACK_PORT` - the port that the webpack dev server runs on
* `ROOT_URL` - the app's root URL
* `WEBPACK_DEVTOOL` - the `devtool` to use in webpack config (e.g. `eval`, `source-map`, etc.)
* `MONGO_DATABASE` - the name of the database within MongoDB to use
* `MONGO_URL` the full URL to MongoDB, including the database name
* `METEOR_SETTINGS` - a JSON literal that will be injected into `Meteor.settings`

## Testing
```
npm test
```
This runs an integration test that successively runs dev and prod mode via the commands above, and tests that Meteor
integration is working via [PhantomJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs-prebuilt) and
[Webdriver.IO](http://webdriver.io/).

It also tests the docker build, so you need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed for the docker test to pass.
